# The Bag
The bag is the primary core gameplay mechanic of Bag Game. The bag is a physical object carried by the player at most points in the game. It holds an **infinitely expandable pocket dimension**.
At any point, the [[Player Character]] can enter the bag's entrance into the bag dimension. Any [[Items]] carried and dropped in the bag dimension by the player will remain inside the bag dimension and persist between scenes.

The physical bag object scales up as items are added to it. The amount of items inside the bag affects certain properties of the bag and player.
As the bag is filled up:
* Bag visual size increases
* Player acceleration reduced
* Player max speed increased
* Landing from a high fall creates more noise and longer recovery time
* Horizontal space available in the bag dimension expands

>The goal is to create constant, interesting decision opportunities for the player. Traveling lightly will increase stealth and mobility but also limit utility options and potential payout for a job (extra valuables are also items). Gathering every item will provide maximum utility but effect movement and stealth, as well as clutter the bag's user interface making it difficult to navigate.
